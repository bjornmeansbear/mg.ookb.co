      <h2>Course Description</h2>
      <article>
        <div class="row">
          <p class="span4">This course focuses on time-based design elements of space, pacing, motion, and interaction as they relate to graphic communication. Projects will push the boundaries of emerging media environments and could explore designer-controlled narrative, haptic interaction, sound, or user interaction. Students are encouraged to focus projects around their thesis work or other self-determined endeavors.</p>
          <p class="span4"><em>K Additions</em><br />This class&rsquo;s goals are to engage motion graphics and web technologies as strategic mediums for experimentation and communication, while introducing software and techniques for creating motion works. The course will consist of a general After Effects &ldquo;how to,&rdquo; covering the basic functions that will allow students to build many kinds of animations directly or, by combining several simple steps, to generate more complex results. From the initial techniques, students will explore how to apply these tools to their work as designers. The last bit will look into interactivity for web and mobile devices for those who are interested. We will look at new interactive and video embedding capabilities in HTML5, animation using CSS3 transitions, and some jQuery/Javascript Magic.</p>
          <p class="span4">Here&rsquo;s the deal: We&rsquo;re gonna try to learn as much about AfterEffects as possible, but without just doing demos. I want students to be able to say, &ldquo;hey, I see how this could fit into my practice, I see what some simple motion designs can do for me either as prototyping tools, mockups, etc.&rdquo; Like how one could easily build some simple environments for mocking up a film shoot. Or, how to prototype an iPad app. Or, how to quickly take someone through a bigger film idea. With that in mind we&rsquo;ll also discuss storyboards/animatics, and other principles and processes around &ldquo;Time + Motion.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>Any student who feels s/he may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the instructor privately to discuss specific needs. Please contact the Learning Resource Center at 410-225-2416, in Bunting 458, to establish eligibility and coordinate reasonable accommodations.

            <h3>Health and Safety</h3>
            <p>It is the responsibility of faculty and students to practice health and safety guidelines relevant to their individual activities, processes, and to review MICA&rsquo;s Emergency Action Plan and attend EHS training. It is each faculty member&rsquo;s responsibility to coordinate with the EHS Office to ensure that all risks associated with their class activities are identified and to assure that their respective classroom procedures mirror the EHS and Academic Department guidelines. Each of these policies and procedures must be followed by all students and faculty. Most importantly, faculty are to act in accordance with all safety compliance, state and federal, as employees of this college and are expected to act as examples of how to create art in a way to minimize risk, and reduce harm to themselves and the environment. Faculty must identify, within each art making process, and require personal protection equipment use, by each student for each class, when applicable. Students are required to purchase personal protection equipment appropriate to their major. Those students who do not have the proper personal protection equipment will not be permitted to attend class until safe measures and personal protection is in place.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="span4">
            <h3>Plagiarism</h3>
            <p>Each discipline within the arts has specific and appropriate means for students to cite or acknowledge sources and the ideas and material of others used in their own work. Students have the responsibility to become familiar with such processes and to carefully follow their use in developing original work.</p>
            <h3>Plagiarism Policy</h3>
            <p>MICA will not tolerate plagiarism, which is defined as claiming authorship of, or using someone else&rsquo;s ideas or work without proper acknowledgment. Without proper attribution, a student may NOT replicate another&rsquo;s work, paraphrase another&rsquo;s ideas, or appropriate images in a manner that violates the specific rules against plagiarism at MICA. In addition, students may not submit the same work for credit in more than one course without the explicit approval of the all of the instructors of the courses involved.</p>
            <h3>Consequences</h3>
            <p>When an instructor has evidence that a student has plagiarized work submitted for course credit, the instructor will confront the student and impose penalties that may include failing the course. In the case of a serious violation or repeated infractions from the same student, the instructor will report the infractions to the department chair.  Depending on the circumstances of the case the department chair may then report the student to the Office of Academic Affairs or Graduate Studies, which may choose to impose further penalties, including suspension or expulsion.</p>
